# Chapter 1 â€“ Transformer Models

This chapter introduces transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), how they work, and how they are used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 1. Introduction

This course is designed to teach how to understand and apply transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

â€¢ Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of teaching computers to understand human language.  
â€¢ LLMs are models trained on massive amounts of text and can perform many NLP tasks (e.g., translation, summarization, question answering).  
â€¢ The course will take a hands-on approach using Hugging Face tools.

Main tools covered in this course:

â€¢ ðŸ¤— Transformers  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Datasets  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Tokenizers  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Accelerate  
â€¢ Hugging Face Hub


## 2. Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models

â€¢ NLP (Natural Language Processing) enables computers to understand, analyze, and generate human language.  
â€¢ It ranges from simple tasks like part-of-speech tagging to advanced applications like chatbots and document summarization.  
â€¢ Traditionally, separate small models were trained for each task (e.g., one model for translation, another for sentiment analysis).

âœ” LLMs have brought a major shift:

â€¢ A single large model can now perform multiple NLP tasks â€” translation, summarization, Q&A, text generation â€” without being fine-tuned for each one.  
â€¢ As model size and training data grow, these models develop new capabilities ("emergent abilities").  
â€¢ This turns them into **general-purpose** language tools.

### ðŸ“Œ My Notes:

â€¢ LLMs unify previously fragmented NLP tools into one system.  
â€¢ This simplifies development and makes deployment more flexible.  
â€¢ For example, ChatGPT can generate code, summarize text, and chat â€” all using the same model.  
â€¢ This accessibility accelerates research and puts powerful AI in the hands of everyday users.
