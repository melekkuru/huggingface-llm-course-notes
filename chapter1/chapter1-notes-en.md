# Chapter 1 â€“ Transformer Models

This chapter introduces transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), how they work, and how they are used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 1. Introduction

This course is designed to teach how to understand and apply transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

â€¢ Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of teaching computers to understand human language.  
â€¢ LLMs are models trained on massive amounts of text and can perform many NLP tasks (e.g., translation, summarization, question answering).  
â€¢ The course will take a hands-on approach using Hugging Face tools.

Main tools covered in this course:

â€¢ ðŸ¤— Transformers  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Datasets  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Tokenizers  
â€¢ ðŸ¤— Accelerate  
â€¢ Hugging Face Hub
